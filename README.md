LOTTRY AI - The First AI Agent-Run Lottery System 🎟️🤖

LOTTRY is the first fully AI Agent-operated lottery system, leveraging autonomous agents to create, fund, and manage user wallets seamlessly. By integrating Crossmint's AI Agents, LOTTRY ensures a frictionless and transparent lottery experience, improving fairness and increasing winning odds.

🔧 How It Works

AI Agent-Generated Wallets 🏦

Users interact with an AI Agent that creates a non-custodial smart wallet.
Wallets are funded via fiat (Crossmint) or multi-chain crypto (LayerZero).

Automated Lottery Participation 🎟
AI Agents track wallet balances and ensure funds are available for ticket purchases.
Users can opt for one-time entries or auto-subscriptions.

On-Chain Fairness & Execution 🔗
Weekly draws are executed via Chainlink VRF, ensuring verifiable randomness.
AI Agents trigger prize distribution and execute payouts autonomously.

Transparent Payouts & Rewards 💰

90% of ticket sales go directly to the prize pool.

Winners receive automatic payouts on their preferred chain.

$LTRY token stakers earn yield from treasury rewards.
