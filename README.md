LOTTRY AI - The First AI Agent-Run Lottery 🎟️🤖

LOTTRY uses AI Agents to create, fund, and manage wallets, ensuring automated, fair, and transparent lottery participation. Wallets are generated via Crossmint, payments processed through LayerZero, and draws executed using Chainlink VRF for verifiable randomness. 90% of ticket sales go to the prize pool, and winners receive automatic payouts on-chain. Built for scalability and fairness, LOTTRY is the next evolution in decentralized lotteries. 🚀
